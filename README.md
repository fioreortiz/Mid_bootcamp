The objective of this analysis was to answer the following questions:

1. How has the behavior of the beneficiary population with the right to public childcare service been in Mexico?
2. How has the behavior of urban workers been in the last 10 years in Mexico, regarding the sector of economic activity, gender and age?
3. What factors can help explain the low enrollment in public day care centers observed in recent years?

As a result of the analysis, the following is observed:

• The number of children with age to use the childcare services in Mexico has decreased by 23% in the last 10 years. Nearly 600 thousand fewer beneficiaries in this age range.
• The number of urban workers has grown by 35% in the last 10 years, highlighting the sectors 'transformation industry', 'commerce' and 'services for companies, individuals and the home', which have presented increases of 48, 34 and 20%, respectively. The entities that have grown the most are Baja California, Guanajuato and Nuevo León with a 54, 46 and 42% increase, respectively.
• It stands out that in the case of women, their participation has increased by 47%, very similar to the increase in the participation of men, with a very similar increase in the transformation industry, but slightly higher in the trade sector and services for companies, individuals and the home.
• However, it is concluded that despite this increase in the labor force and a greater participation of women, the population that can make use of the childcare service has decreased.


Next steps:
During the process of preparing the presentation, it was identified that when eliminating the NaN values, Mexico City was excluded from the analysis, because with this action the municipalities were eliminated, which is a lower geographical level, and with it the associated data. Therefore, the database will have to be reviewed again, so as not to eliminate these values.
The fact that the variables that should be categorical come with integer values complicated the statistical grouping, so it will be necessary to improve the quality of the preparation of the databases.
It is inferred a priori that there could be some type of relationship between the decrease in the beneficiary population of age to use the daycare service and the low enrollment observed. But it is necessary to design some type of regression model to test this hypothesis, and to incorporate other types of variables that could influence enrollment in public day care centers.
